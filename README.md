This was designed using HTML to promote Estee Lauderâ€™s new foundation line. The objective of 
this project was creating a design that was accessible on all screen sizes, which I addressed 
using CSS. I used JavaScript to create visual effects for some of the images and to create a 
disappearing navigation bar.
